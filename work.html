												<h3>Future Technologies Inc</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I came onto the Future Technologies team with zero experience in C# and .NET framework. After a month of learning, I am contributing daily to our client's projects.
												Working in an agile environment has helped workflow and keep the team organized. 
											   The .NET framework is great for getting a project started quickly with its built-in features that make development a lot easier. 
												</p>
												<p>Developing in a different stack was initially a challenge since the framework used was not the traditional MVC framework used by most web developers. </p>												<ul class="actions">

												<h3>The Motley Fool</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This role was my first software developer job after my graduation from my coding bootcamp. Coming from a Javascript background I had to learn PHP before the start of the internship. 
												Lando and Docker was used daily during the internship since it was used for local development. 
												Apart from contributing to the Global Teams websites daily the most important lesson I learned from the 2 short months was understanding clean code and how it 
												affects the entire teams workflow. Writing clean code is 
												something that for most of the time doesn't need to be
												explained by comments. Respecting how long methods should be as well as classes can help the entire team. Everyday at the internship started with a daily
												 stand-up explaining what issues we have come across and plans for the future development. 
											</p>
											<p>The longest project I worked on with The Motley Fool Global team was an email verification. In the past global users could enter any unverified email through our newsletter 
												to get access to preminum content. This was an issue since our email capture was low and could eventually hurt email marketing. This feature I added to the site required a refresher on AJAX since I needed
												to communicate both my client-side Javascript and PHP server-side to the browser. The page refreshing to the preminum content was an issue that was solved with AJAX. Other projects I worked on with The Motley Fool
												were creating a Django quiz app to help bring in level 1 members. Also working with other teams to create scripts to organize JSON objects was a great learning experiance since I never pharsed objects into a CSV file.

												<h3>Modis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After graudating High School in 2019 I was offered a contract role to work at a Google Data Center. With my experiance in server and computer hardware I was excited to make lots of connections! During my 3 month contract I was tasked with
												installing and replacing servers as well as completle motherboard upgrade/swaps. Running ethernet cables and fiber optics to other servers was intially hard since I needed some experiance with switches and how they work. 
											</p>
											<p>I was surrounded in an enviroment where my co workers used linux OS daily which has inspired me to pick up on that skill with my new project. Working with it is a time saver since theres so much helpful information out there that can 
												solve any issue that you're currently on.
