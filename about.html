							<div class="content">
								<p>I recently graduated High School in 2019. I always valued work experience over getting a college degree. Out of High School, I accepted a contract role at a Google Data Center and learned how to disassemble server racks and understand how to connect servers to the network. After the contract ended I attended a trade school for 3 months to learn web development. Immediately after graduating the boot camp, I received an internship offer from The Motley
									Fool for 2 months. Before the internship started I had to learn PHP which was completely different from what I learned during the 3-month trade school. 
								</p>

							<p>After the internship at The Motley Fool, I was offered a full-time role as a contractor for the DoD. Coming onto the team I needed to learn C# and the .NET framework. I also had to get a certification in Security+ by CompTia Which I currently hold today. 
                                My plans for the future are to continue to study for my CCNA certification as well as continue to do home projects on my server. I also currently hold a DoD secret clearance.
