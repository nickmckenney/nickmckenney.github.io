										This was my first project as an intern at The Motley Fool. Coming onto the team I initially had to learn PHP and understand the team's workflow. Using Lando as a local development environment and docker to host. 
                                        initially, the hardest part was understanding where do I incorporate the new feature I wanted to add. Coming from an environment where I understood the entire code base since I wrote it from beginning to end it was
                                        a completely different feeling I experienced since I had to read another developer's code.	
									</p>
									<p>
										After understanding the development environment I used Neverbounce as the 3rd party API to verify emails that users would enter for the newsletter. If the email was fake I had to prevent a
                                         page refresh and prompt a message to the user. This could only be done using AJAX since the Server-side PHP and client-side Javascript need to work together. A valuable lesson I learned from this 
										 project was how helpful documentation can be when working with API. Reading the entire Neverbounce documentation would have saved me and the team time during this project.
